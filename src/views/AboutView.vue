    <p>
      Apart from the fact I only understood how
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)" target="_blank">Minesweeper</a> works in my early
      tewnties, I've always enjoyed the game for its colors and simplicity.

      Nowadays it reminds me of a time when things were simpler, slow-paced and tech didn't need much to impress
      someone.
    </p>
    <p>This is my tribute to an ancient game that never gets old.</p>
